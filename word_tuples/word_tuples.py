This questions has two parts: A and B.

You have been provided with unit tests for each part in word_tuples_test.py.
Do not alter any of the tests.  All tests should pass for your solution to be
complete.

Do a second version of the function which uses list comprehension instead.

You may update the main function below for the purposes of manual testing and
debugging.
