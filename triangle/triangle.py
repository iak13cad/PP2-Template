Complete the function below, that given an integer between 0 and 9, prints an
increasing sequence starting with only 0 and ending with 0 1 ... n.  See below
for examples.
If n is < 0 or > 9, the function should raise a ValueError with a message of
"n must be between 0 and 9 inclusive" printed from the function.
Your function must use recursion.
You have been provided with a main and test cases using the 
exception handling construct (note: this doesn't use pytest!).
Use main() as it is given.
Expected Output:
    number_triangle(3):
    0
    0 1 
    0 1 2 
    0 1 2 3 
    number_triangle(9):
    0
    0 1 
    0 1 2 
    0 1 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
    number_triangle(0):
    0
    number_triangle(-1):
    n must be between 0 and 9 inclusive
    number_triangle(10):
    n must be between 0 and 9 inclusive

Finish your function below.
